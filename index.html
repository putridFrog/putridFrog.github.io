            <p>I was born in Cranberry Township, PA but moved to Huntersville, NC when I was 10 and lived there ever sense.</p>
            <p>I go to a community college near me and major in Computer Science there.</p>

              I don't really have any web develpoment background except for what I did in CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.
              My final project for that class was a website mimicing a terminal with a bunch of fun commands, I tried my best to match the style of one too.

              I also dont have much of a background in software develpoment besides what I have done in classes.
              I did go to a hackathon before. There I tried and failed to make a face recognition software, all it could do is detect faces not recognize.

              The reason I want to take this course is because I want more knowledge in web develpoment. I have a lot of fun making websites but I don't feel 
              like I have enough knowledge to take me anywhere with it.
